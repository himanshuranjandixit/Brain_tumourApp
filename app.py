        "Treatment typically includes a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. "
        "Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial for improving outcomes. Please consult a neurologist or neuro-oncologist as soon as possible for detailed diagnosis and treatment planning."
    ),
    'Meningioma': (
        "Meningiomas are tumors that arise from the meninges, the protective layers of the brain and spinal cord. "
        "Most meningiomas are benign and slow-growing, but they can cause problems depending on their size and location. "
        "Treatment options may include regular monitoring, surgical removal, or radiation therapy. "
        "It's important to get a detailed scan and consult with a neurologist or neurosurgeon to determine the best course of action."
    ),
    'No Tumor': (
        "Your brain MRI does not show any signs of a tumor. This is a positive result. "
        "However, if you are experiencing symptoms like headaches, vision problems, or memory issues, please consult a medical professional to explore other possible causes. "
        "Maintaining brain health through regular check-ups, hydration, sleep, and mental stimulation is always recommended."
    ),
    'Pituitary': (
        "Pituitary tumors originate in the pituitary gland and can affect hormone production, which may lead to symptoms like vision changes, fatigue, mood swings, and hormonal imbalances. "
        "Most pituitary tumors are benign and slow-growing. Treatment may involve medication, hormone therapy, surgery, or radiation depending on the tumor type and effects. "
        "An endocrinologist and a neurosurgeon should be consulted for proper hormone testing and imaging to plan an effective treatment strategy."
